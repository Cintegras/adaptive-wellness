# FormCoach Stabilization and React Native Rebuild - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to stabilize the FormCoach project with Supabase Cloud and implement the React Native rebuild with Expo.

## Overview

The implementation focused on two main areas:
1. **Stabilizing the existing FormCoach project** with Supabase Cloud
2. **Setting up a React Native rebuild** using Expo, NativeWind, and React Navigation

## 1. Stabilization Changes

### Script Fixes

#### `start-project.sh`
- Updated to work with Supabase Cloud as the primary option
- Added verification of Supabase Cloud connection
- Added increased memory limits to prevent timeouts
- Improved error handling and user feedback

#### `execute-sql-remote.js`
- Fixed to use the `exec_sql` stored procedure
- Added check for the existence of the procedure
- Improved error handling and parameter naming
- Updated environment variable handling

#### `seed-dev.mjs`
- Converted from TypeScript to ES Modules format
- Simplified environment filter
- Updated to work with Supabase Cloud
- Improved error handling

#### `run.sh`
- Fixed to match the project's directory structure with packages/backend and packages/frontend
- Added support for different backend file structures
- Added increased memory limits
- Improved process management

### Supabase Cloud Setup

- Created SQL file for the `exec_sql` stored procedure
- Updated documentation with Supabase Cloud setup instructions
- Added verification of Supabase connection in scripts

### Documentation Updates

- Updated `START_HERE.md` with:
  - Supabase Cloud setup instructions
  - Docker instructions for optional local Supabase testing
  - Azure AD B2C setup for Supabase OAuth
  - Improved troubleshooting section
  - React Native development instructions

## 2. React Native Rebuild

### Setup Scripts

- Created `setup-expo.sh` for initializing the Expo project with:
  - NativeWind configuration
  - Supabase integration
  - React Navigation setup
  - Authentication context
  - Basic screens

- Created `setup-expo-screens.sh` for adding:
  - Complete screen implementations
  - Exercise logging functionality
  - Testing infrastructure

### Key Components

#### Supabase Configuration
- Implemented secure storage for auth tokens
- Added platform-specific storage (Expo Secure Store for mobile, localStorage for web)
- Configured environment variables

#### Authentication
- Implemented AuthContext with sign in, sign up, and sign out functionality
- Added Apple Sign-In for iOS
- Implemented protected routes

#### Navigation
- Set up bottom tab navigation for main screens
- Implemented stack navigation for auth flow and modal screens
- Added type safety with TypeScript

#### Screens
- **LoginScreen**: Email/password login with Apple Sign-In option
- **SignUpScreen**: User registration
- **HomeScreen**: Dashboard with recent workouts
- **PlansScreen**: Workout plan management
- **HistoryScreen**: Workout history tracking
- **ProfileScreen**: User profile management
- **ExerciseLogScreen**: Exercise logging with sets, reps, weights, and feedback

### Testing Infrastructure

- Set up unit/integration tests with @testing-library/react-native
- Implemented web E2E tests with Jest/jsdom
- Added test examples for LoginScreen and web navigation

### Documentation

- Created comprehensive README.md for the mobile app
- Added detailed instructions for:
  - Installation and setup
  - Supabase configuration
  - Testing
  - Building for production
  - Azure AD B2C integration

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Script fixes for Supabase Cloud compatibility
- ✅ Supabase Cloud setup instructions and SQL files
- ✅ React Native project setup with Expo
- ✅ Authentication implementation with Supabase
- ✅ Navigation setup with React Navigation
- ✅ Core screens implementation
- ✅ Exercise logging functionality
- ✅ Apple Sign-In integration
- ✅ Web testing support via React Native Web
- ✅ Unit/integration tests setup
- ✅ Web E2E tests with Jest/jsdom
- ✅ Documentation updates

### Pending
- ⏳ Mobile E2E tests with Detox
- ⏳ Comprehensive test coverage (target: 80%)
- ⏳ EAS build configuration for CI/CD
- ⏳ App Store submission preparation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**: Implement Detox E2E tests for mobile and increase test coverage
2. **CI/CD Setup**: Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and EAS builds
3. **App Store Preparation**: Finalize privacy manifest and submission assets
4. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize app performance
5. **Feature Enhancements**: Add additional features based on user feedback

## Conclusion

The implementation has successfully stabilized the FormCoach project with Supabase Cloud and set up a solid foundation for the React Native rebuild with Expo. The mobile app now supports the core functionality of workout plan management, exercise logging, and user profile management, with a focus on iOS as the primary platform and web support for development testing.
